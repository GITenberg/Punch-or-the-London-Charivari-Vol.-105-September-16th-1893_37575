<h2>THE STRIKER'S VADE MECUM.</h2>

<div class="ind2">

<p><i>Question.</i> You think it is a good thing to strike?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> Yes, when there is no other remedy.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Is there ever any other remedy?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Never. At least, so say the secretaries.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then you stand by the opinions of the officials?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why, of course; because they are paid to give them.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But have not the employers any interests?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Lots, but they are not worthy the working-man's consideration.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But are not their interests yours?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, and that is the way we guard over them.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But surely it is the case of cutting off the nose to spite
the mouth?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> And why not, if the mouth is too well fed.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But are not arguments better than bludgeons?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> No, and bludgeons are less effective than revolvers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But may not the use of revolvers produce the military?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, but they can do nothing without a magistrate reading
the Riot Act.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But, the Riot Act read, does not the work become serious?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Probably. But at any rate the work is lawful, because
unremunerative.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But how are the wives and children of strikers to live if
their husbands and fathers earn no wages?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> On strike money.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But does all the strike money go to the maintenance of
the hearth and the home?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Of course not, for a good share of it is wanted for the
baccy-shop and the public-house.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But if strikes continue will not trade suffer?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Very likely, but trade represents the masters.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And if trade is driven away from the country will it
come back?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Most likely not, but that is a matter for the future.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But is not the future of equal importance to the present?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Not at all, for a day's thought is quite enough for a
day's work.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> Then a strike represents either nothing or idleness?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Yes, bludgeons or beer.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> And what is the value of reason?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> Why, something less than smoke.</p>

the above titles can be altered to match. True or not, yet "so it is

<h2>AT THE SHAFTESBURY.</h2>

<p>The few theatres now open seem to be doing uncommonly good
business. The Shaftesbury, with <i>Morocco Bound</i>, was as nearly full
as it could be in the first week of September, when the cry is not
yet "They are coming back," but they are remaining away. Another
week will make all the difference. <i>Morocco Bound</i> is not a piece at
all, but a sort of variety show, just held together by the thinnest
thread of what, for want of a better word, may be temporarily dignified
as "plot." Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Danby</span> is decidedly funny in it. Mr.
<span class="sc">Templar Saxe</span> is a pretty singer. Mr. <span class="sc">George Grossmith</span> well
sustains the eccentric reputation of his family name; and, if any
opposition manager could induce the present representative of
<i>Spoofah Bey</i> to appear at another house, it would be "all up"
with <i>Morocco Bound</i>, as such a transfer would entirely take
"the Shine" out of <i>this</i> piece. Miss <span class="sc">Jennie McNulty</span> does nothing
in particular admirably; and Miss <span class="sc">Letty Lind</span>, charming in her
<i>entr'acte</i> of skirt-dancing, is still better in her really capital dance
with the agile <span class="sc">Charles Danby</span>. This entertainment has reached
its hundred and fiftieth night (!!!), and all those who are prevented
from going North to stalk the wily grouse may do worse
than spend a night among the Moors in <i>Morocco Bound</i>. Oddly
enough, but quite appropriately, the acting-manager in front, who
looks after the fortunes of Morocco and its Moors, is Mr. <span class="sc">A. Blackmore</span>.
Out of compliment he might have let in an "a" after the
"k," dropped the final "e," and given himself a second "o." Still,
in keeping with the fitness of things, he has done well in being there.</p>

<h2>"THE BOOK THAT FAILED."</h2>

<blockquote><p>
[A publisher writes to <i>The Author</i> to say that, for the first time in his
experience, the writer of a book which was not a success has sent him an
unsolicited cheque to compensate him for the loss he has sustained by
producing it.]
</p></blockquote>

<h3><span class="sc">As Things are To-day.</span></h3>

<p><i>Publisher (nastily).</i> I tell you that it's no earthly use your asking
about profits, because there are none.</p>

<p><i>Author (amazed).</i> No profits! And you really mean to tell me
that the public has not thought fit to purchase my shilling work of
genius&mdash;<i>The Maiming of Mendoza?</i> By our agreement only a
paltry six thousand copies of the work had to be bought before my
royalty of a penny a volume began.</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> I am quite aware of it. The sale of the six thousand
copies would just about have repaid us for cost of production.
As a matter of fact, only three thousand have been sold. We've lost
heavily, and very much regret we were ever induced to accept
the work.</p>

<p><i>Author.</i> And you really ask me to believe that after such a sale as
that a loss on your part is possible? Why, if you take price of
printing at&mdash;&mdash;</p> <p class="right">[<i>Goes elaborately into cost of production.</i></p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> Yes, but you see the price of everything has gone up
in our trade. Binding is now ten per cent. dearer, composing is&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Also goes into precise and prolonged details.</i></p>

<p><i>Author (turning desperate at last).</i> Oh, let us end this chatter!
You really say that no cheque whatever is due to me for all my
labours?</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> Not a single penny. It's the other way about.</p>

<p><i>Author (leaving).</i> And you call this "the beneficial system of
royalties," do you? Good day! And if I don't set the Society of
Authors at you before I am a day older, then my name's not <span class="sc">Bulwer

<p><i>Utterly Unknown Novelist.</i> Then I am afraid that my last three-volumed
work of fiction, in spite of the cordial way in which it was
reviewed by my brother-in-law in the <i>Weekly Dotard</i>, my maternal
uncle in the <i>Literary Spy</i>, and a few other relatives on the daily
press, has not upon the whole been a decided success?</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> Well, it's useless to conceal the fact, that from a mere
base material point of view, the publication of <i>The Boiling of
Benjamin</i> has not quite answered our expectations. In fact, we
have lost a couple of thousand pounds over it. But (<i>more
cheerfully</i>) what of that? It is a pleasure to lose money over
introducing good work to the public; a positive privilege to be
sacrificed on such an altar as <i>The Boiling of Benjamin</i>. So say no
more on <i>that</i> head!</p>

<p><i>U. U. Novelist (enthusiastically).</i> Good and generous man! But I
will say more! You recollect that the terms you made with me
were a thousand pounds down, and a hundred pounds a month for
life or until the copyright expired?</p>

<p><i>Publisher (groaning slightly).</i> Oh, yes! I remember it very well.</p>

<p><i>U. U. Novelist.</i> And that I have already received cheques for
one thousand and five hundred pounds, without your mentioning a
word about the loss you have been nobly and silently enduring?</p>

<p><i>Publisher.</i> An agreement's an agreement, and you are only experiencing
one result of the beneficial system of royalties.</p>

<p><i>U. U. Novelist.</i> Quite so! But if there is to be division of profits,
there should be division of losses as well. So (<i>taking out chequebook,
and hurriedly writing in it</i>) there! Not a word of thanks!
It's merely repaying you the fifteen hundred I've received, with
another thousand to compensate you for the loss on production.</p>

<p><i>Publisher (melted into tears).</i> Oh, thanks, thanks! You have
averted ruin from my starving little ones! And if you <i>should</i> wish
to bring out any other work of &mdash;&mdash;. He is gone, to escape my

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Scene II.</span>&mdash;<i>Same as preceding.</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>is slowly
recovering from the mental collapse produced by the mention of the word "Eldorado."</i></p>

<p><i>Mrs. Toovey.</i> <span class="sc">Althea</span> is out of the room, Pa, so there is no
reason why you should not speak out plainly.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Toovey (to himself).</i> No reason&mdash;oh! But I must say <i>something</i>.
If only I knew whether it was my Eldorado&mdash;but, no, it's a
mere coincidence! (<i>Aloud&mdash;shakily.</i>) <span class="sc">Charles</span>, my boy, you&mdash;you've
shocked me very much indeed, as you can see. But, about the
name of this establishment, now&mdash;isn't it a curious one for&mdash;for
a <i>music-hall</i>, <span class="sc">Charles</span>? M&mdash;mightn't it be confused
with&mdash;well&mdash;say
a <i>mine</i>, now?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> <span class="sc">Theophilus</span>, this is scarcely the tone&mdash;&mdash;. I expected
you to give this misguided boy a solemn warning of the ruin he may incur by having anything to do with such a haunt.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (to himself).</i> Ah, I'm afraid I'm only too well qualified
to do that. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I do,
<span class="sc">Charles</span>, I <i>do</i>&mdash;though at the
same time, I can quite understand
how one may, unwittingly&mdash;I
mean, you might not be
aware of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> You, Pa, of all people in the world, trying to find excuses
for his depravity! The very name of the place is enough to indicate its nature!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (hastily).</i> No, my love, surely not. <i>There</i> I think you go
too far&mdash;too far altogether!</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> I appeal to Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>
to say whether such a place is a proper resort for <i>any</i>
young man.</p>

<p><i>Curphew (to himself).</i> Wish I
was well out of this! (<i>Aloud.</i>)
I&mdash;I really don't feel qualified to
give an opinion, Mrs. <span class="sc">Toovey</span>.
Many young men <i>do</i> go to them,
I believe.</p>

<p><i>Charles (to himself).</i> Is this
chap a prig, or a humbug? I'll
draw him. (<i>Aloud.</i>) I suppose,
from that, you never think of
going yourself?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew's</span> tastes
are rather different from yours,
<span class="sc">Charles</span>. I am very sure that
he is never to be seen among the
audience at any music-hall, are
you, Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>?</p>

<p><i>Curph. (to himself).</i> Could I
break it to her gently, I wonder.
(<i>Aloud.</i>) Never&mdash;my professional
duties make that impossible.</p>

<p><i>Charles (to himself).</i> I knew
he was a muff! (<i>Aloud.</i>) I
should have thought you could
easily get a pass to any place you wanted to go&mdash;in your profession.</p>

<p><i>Curph. (to himself).</i> He suspects something. (<i>Aloud.</i>) Should
you? Why?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Oh, as you're on a newspaper, you know. Don't they
always have a free pass for everywhere?</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> If they have, I have never had occasion to make use of it.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Well, of course you may turn up your nose at music-halls,
and say they're not intellectual enough for you.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Pardon me, I never said I turned up my nose at them,
though you'll admit they don't profess to make a strong appeal to
the intellect.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> If they did, you wouldn't catch <i>me</i> there. But I can tell
you, it's not so bad as you seem to think; every now and then they
get hold of a really good thing. You might do worse than drop into
the El. or the Val., the Valhalla, you know, some evening&mdash;just
to hear <span class="sc">Walter Wildfire</span>.</p>

<p><i>Curph.</i> Much obliged; but I can't imagine myself going there
for such a purpose.</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T.</i> <span class="sc">Charles</span>, if you suppose Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> would allow
himself
to be corrupted by a boy like you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> But look here, Aunt. <span class="sc">Walter Wildfire's</span> all right&mdash;he
is <i>really</i>; he was a gentleman, and all that, before he took to
this sort of thing, and he writes all his own songs&mdash;and ripping they
are, too! His line is the Broken-down Plunger, you know.
(Mrs. T. <i>repudiates any knowledge of this type</i>.) He's got one song
about a Hansom Cabby who has to drive the girl he was engaged to
before he was broke, and she's married some other fellow since, and
has got her little daughter with her, and the child gives him his
fare, and&mdash;well, somehow it makes you feel choky when he sings it.
Even Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> couldn't find anything to complain of in <span class="sc">Walter
Wildfire</span>!</p>

<p><i>Althea (who has entered during this speech).</i> Mamma, I can't find
your spectacles anywhere. Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span>, who is this <span class="sc">Walter
Wildfire</span> <span class="sc">Charles</span> is so enthusiastic about?</p>

<p><i>Mrs. T. (hastily).</i> No one that Mr. <span class="sc">Curphew</span> knows anything
of&mdash;and
certainly not a fit person to be mentioned in <i>your</i> hearing, my
dear, so let us say no more about it. Supper must be on the table
by this time; we had better go in, and try to find a more befitting
topic for conversation. <span class="sc">Charles</span>, have the goodness to put this&mdash;this
<i>disgraceful</i> paper in your pocket, and let me see no more of it.
I shall get your Uncle to speak to you seriously after supper.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (aloud, with alacrity).</i> Yes, my love, I shall certainly
speak to <span class="sc">Charles</span> after supper&mdash;very seriously. (<i>To himself.</i>) And
end this awful uncertainty!</p>

<p><i>Curph. (to himself, as he follows
to the Dining-room).</i> "Not
a fit person to be mentioned in
her hearing!" I wonder. Would
<i>she</i> say the same if she knew?
When shall I be able to tell her?
It would be madness as yet.</p>

<p class="ind"><span class="sc">Scene III.</span>&mdash;<i>The Study.</i> Mr.
<span class="sc">Toovey</span> and <span class="sc">Charles</span> <i>are alone
together</i>. Mr. <span class="sc">Toovey</span> <i>has
found it impossible to come to
the point</i>.</p>

<p><i>Charles (looking at his watch).</i>
I say, Uncle, I'm afraid I must
trouble you for that wigging at
once, if I'm going to catch my
train back. You've only seven-and-a-half
minutes left to exhort
me in, so make the most of it.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (with embarrassment).</i>
Yes, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, but&mdash;I don't wish
to be hard on you, my boy&mdash;we
are all liable to err, and&mdash;and, in
point of fact, the reason I was
a little upset at the mention of
the Eldorado is, that a very dear
old friend of mine, <span class="sc">Charles</span>,
has lately lost a considerable sum
through investing in a Company
of the same name&mdash;and, just for
the moment, it struck me that
it might have been the music-hall&mdash;which
of course is absurd,
eh?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Rather! He couldn't
possibly have lost it in the <i>music-hall</i>,
Uncle; it's ridiculous!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (relieved).</i> Just what I
thought. A man in his&mdash;ah&mdash;responsible
position&mdash;oh no. But
he's lost it in this other Company.
And they've demanded a hundred and seventy-five pounds over
and above the five hundred he paid on his shares. Now <i>you</i> know
the law. Can they <i>do</i> that, <span class="sc">Charles</span>? Is he legally liable to pay?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Couldn't possibly say without knowing all the facts.
It's a Limited Company, I suppose?</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I&mdash;I don't know, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, but I can show you the
official document which&mdash;ah&mdash;happens to be in my hands. I'm
afraid I didn't examine it very carefully&mdash;I was too upset. (<i>He
goes to his secrétaire, and returns with a paper, which he offers
for</i> <span class="sc">Charles's</span> <i>inspection</i>.) You won't mind my covering up the
name? My&mdash;my friend wouldn't care for it to be seen&mdash;I'm
sure.</p>

<p><i>Charles (glances at the top of the paper, and roars with
laughter).</i> I say, Uncle, your friend <i>must</i> be a jolly old juggins!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (miserably).</i> I don't think he could be described as <i>jolly</i>
just now, <span class="sc">Charles</span>.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> No, but I mean, not all there, you know&mdash;trifle weak
in the upper story.</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (with dignity).</i> He never professed to be a man of business,
<span class="sc">Charles</span>, any more than myself, and his inexperience was
shamefully abused&mdash;<i>most</i> shamefully!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Abused! But look here, Uncle, do you mean to say you
don't see that this is a dividend warrant!</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg 125]</span>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I believe that is
what they call it. And&mdash;and
is he bound to send them a cheque for it at once, <span class="sc">Charles</span>?</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Send them a
cheque? Great <span class="sc">Scott</span>! Why
it <i>is</i> a cheque! They're paying
<i>him</i>. It's the half-yearly
dividend on his five hundred,
at the rate of seventy per cent.
And he was going to&mdash;&mdash;Oh,
Lord!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (rising, and shaking
C.'s hands with effusion).</i> My
<i>dear</i> <span class="sc">Charles</span>; how can I
thank you? If you <i>knew</i>
what a load you've taken off
my mind! Then the Company
<i>isn't</i> bankrupt&mdash;it's
paying seventy per cent.!
Why, I needn't mind telling
your Aunt. (<i>With restored
complacency.</i>) Of course, my
boy, I have never occupied
myself with City matters&mdash;but,
none the less, I believe
I can trust my natural
shrewdness&mdash;I had a sort of
instinct, <span class="sc">Charles</span>, from the
first, that that mine was
perfectly sound. I knew I
could trust <span class="sc">Larkins</span>.</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> <i>You</i>, Uncle! Then
it was <i>you</i> who was your
friend all the time? Oh,
you're really <i>too</i> rich, you
know!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T.</i> I have never desired
it; but it will certainly be a
very useful addition to our&mdash;ah&mdash;modest
income, <span class="sc">Charles</span>.
But you should check yourself,
my boy, in this&mdash;ah&mdash;immoderate
laughter. There is nothing that I can see to cause
such mirth in the fact of your
Uncle's having made a fortunate
investment in a gold-mine.</p>

<p><i>Charles (as soon as he can
speak).</i> But it <i>ain't</i> a mine,
Uncle, it&mdash;it's the music-hall! Give you my word it is. If you
don't believe me, look at the address on the warrant, and you'll see
it's the same as on this programme. You're a shareholder in the
Eldorado Palace of Varieties, Piccadilly!</p>

<p><i>Mr. T. (falling back).</i> No, <span class="sc">Charles</span>! I&mdash;I acquired them in the
most perfect innocence!</p>

<p><i>Charles.</i> Innocence! I'd back you for that against an entire
Infant School, Uncle. But I say, I must be off now. If I were you,
I <i>wouldn't</i> mention this to Aunt. And look here. I'd better leave
you this. (<i>He hands him the Eldorado programme.</i>) It's more in
your line than mine now.</p> <p class="ind2">[<i>He goes out, and is heard chuckling in

<h4>(<i>From our Special Correspondent on the Spot.</i>)</h4>

<p><i>Monday.</i>&mdash;Everyone is
afraid that the action of the
Government in imposing a tax
upon cycles will have serious
effects. Although the fleet do
not use the carriages thus surcharged,
it is not unlikely the
armour-plated <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'cruised'">cruiser</ins> <i>Impartial</i>
may threaten to bombard
the capital. Altogether the
situation is critical.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;My fears were
well-founded. The capital has
been bombarded, but not on
account of the cycle tax, but
to show that the commander
of the armour-plated cruiser
<i>Impartial</i> objects to the proposed
equalisation of Poor
Rates. Fortunately the Government
torpedo-catcher
<i>Cupid</i> was able to beat off the
<i>Impartial</i> before serious damage
could be done. Still, the
question of the acquisition of
the telegraphs is causing
much excitement amongst the
army.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;My worst
fears are realised. The General
in command of the garrison
has made the Church Tithes
question a <i>casus belli</i>. As the
Government insisted upon proceeding
with the second reading,
the General thought it his
duty to set fire to all the public
offices. This is considered to
be an extreme step by many
important members of the
Opposition.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;This morning
dense bodies of troops arrived
opposite the House of Representatives,
with a view to bringing pressure to bear upon
the opponents to the Public Baths and Wash-house Bill, which it
will be remembered passed through the Committee stage with the
assistance of a cavalry regiment and three batteries of artillery.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;The Budget has disappointed both the fleet and the
army, the combined forces have taken possession of the capital, and
the Government is practically overturned.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.</i>&mdash;Matters are still unsettled. The capital is still in
possession of the insurgents. The Premier has been released on condition
that he promises to bring in a Bill for the improvement of the
Law of Bankruptcy early next Session. It is rumoured that a body
of fresh troops are on their way to the metropolis in charge of a
measure for the Abolition of Tithes, which they desire to carry
through the Upper House at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p><i>Sunday.</i>&mdash;The Admiral commanding the fleet, having proclaimed
himself Dictator, attended church in state. On his way back to his
palace he was surrounded by the troops, and, after a tough engagement,
was forced to retire to his flag-ship with heavy loss. The garrison
would have attended the afternoon service <i>en grande tenue</i> had
not the fleet opened fire upon the recently evacuated cathedral. In
spite of recent events the populace still exhibit uneasiness.</p>

<h2>AN OLD FRIEND DUE NORTH.</h2>

<p>For a really humorous drawing commend
me to the picture in the <i>Daily Graphic</i> of
Saturday, September 9, representing "the
civic procession to the luncheon given to Lord
and Lady <span class="sc">Aberdeen</span> by the Lord Mayor of
Liverpool." The stately party is preceded
by a Piper&mdash;of course, it is his worship the
Mayor and common councillors who pay the
piper and call the tune on this occasion&mdash;who
is stepping out jauntily. But notice his
glance; notice the Mayor's expression as he
tries to prevent himself laughing, and hides
one eye with the sword of State; notice Lord
and Lady <span class="sc">Aberdeen</span>, the latter looking a
trifle annoyed, while his Lordship is struggling
with painfully suppressed merriment. What
is it that has nearly upset their gravity and
spoilt the procession? The explanation is at
hand. On the left of the picture in the
foreground stands, <i>en evidence</i> it is true, but
with a reverential air as of one who knows
his place in society and keeps it, our old
friend and contributor, <i>Robert the Waiter</i>!!
It must be he. It is the very man, unless
he has a Scotch double, or unless he was born
a twin, and the other <span class="sc">Robert</span> was a Scotchman.
There he is. Get the paper and see.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE MAN IN THE SOUTH.</h2>

<p>Having on some occasions during, I admit, the spring and autumn,
spent a few days at Pinemouth on the South-Western Coast, and
having had the enormous value of the place as an ultra salubrious
health-restorer most energetically impressed upon me from time to
time by such thoroughly disinterested persons as local members of
the medical profession who, as a rule, took their holiday during the
summer season, merely because they couldn't get the opportunity
at any other time&mdash;a fact in itself going a long way (as they themselves
did&mdash;to Switzerland
and elsewhere) to prove the
peculiar healthfulness of this
seaside resort, and the place
having been further highly
recommended (by residents
who, having houses to let
for the summer, were quite
disinterested) as quiet and
delightfully refreshing, and
having, in fact, heard all
that could be said in favour
of Pinemouth as a Summer
Resort by those who had
only the welfare of their
dear friends at heart (and
if such interest did put a
little ready capital in their
pockets through taking their
dear friends' houses&mdash;where
is the harm?), I, <span class="sc">Robinson
Crusoe</span>, Jun., "The Man
of the First of August"
(that being the beginning of
my tenancy) determined on
trying Pinemouth (a name
that I find spelt with unpardonable
familiarity in some
local guide-books, thus&mdash;"P'm'th"&mdash;an
abbreviation
leaving the name scarcely a
shred of its original character),
and when I say so
boldly, "<i>I</i> determined," any
other Paterfamilias will at
once know what <i>that</i> means.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 500px;"><a href="images/129-800.png"><img src="images/129-500.png" width="500" height="464" alt="Mr. Robinson Crusoe" /></a>
<p class="center">Mr. Robinson Crusoe, Junior, deciding on where to spend his few
weeks' holiday.</p></div>

<p>Of course, directly "P'm'th" was decided upon, some of our
friends shook their heads, others observed dubiously that "they
<i>had</i> heard it wasn't such a <i>very</i> bad place in August," while the
majority bade me farewell with forced cheeriness, expressed the
heartiest hopes for our health and happiness in the new climate we
were going to try, and in a general way our excellent friends and
acquaintances were almost as enthusiastic and hopeful on the score
of our enjoying ourselves and benefiting by the change, as were
the American acquaintances of <i>Martin Chuzzlewit</i> and <i>Mark Tapley</i>
when those two emigrants were starting for the great dismal swamp.</p>

<p>Finding that we had made all our arrangements, and had actually
signed and sealed the bond, and delivered ourselves over into the
hands of the "P'm'thians," our friends, who, as we subsequently
ascertained, had never been near the place, or, if they had, had been
there at a hopelessly wrong time, and had pitched their tents in an
utterly wrong quarter, made ill-disguised attempts at speaking
gently and kindly of "P'm'th," allowing that possibly "it might
not, at this time of year, be so hot as had been represented,"&mdash;a
theory which, like one recently put forward by a tender-hearted
theologian, was immediately placed in the <i>Index Expurgatorius</i> by
the Inevitable Uncompromising One who professed a thorough knowledge
of the climate, and who asserted that in this particular year,
when the Summer had been abnormally hot and was going to be
more abnormally hot than ever, we should find "P'm'th" absolutely
unbearable.</p>

<p>But, as the adventurous hero of "<i>Excelsior</i>" would listen to
nobody, so I (representing "we") refused to hear the prognosticators
of woe, and adhered
manfully to my purpose. In
the very hottest season,
when the thermometer in
every London house went
so high that it had to be
deluged with wholesome antiseptic
Condyment, and
doors and windows were
everywhere left open so as
to obtain a through draught,&mdash;for
people lived on
draughts of all sorts in those
doggiest of dog-days and
on little else,&mdash;we, that is
all the <span class="sc">Crusoes</span>, were seated
in our garden looking on to
the heather and the sea,
open to all the winds of
heaven&mdash;and getting one of
them, the south-east, blowing
softly and sweetly across
our south-western height.
Gracefully and gratefully
we arose to play tennis, and
sat down again after the
evening meal to take our
coffee and cigarettes. Bless
thee, P'm'th! thou art
delicious! thou art refreshing!
Hot in the hottest
August ever known thou
certainly art, that is, at midday,
down in your valley and
your town! But up above
on the Western Heights,
looking across an expanse of purple and yellow, uninclosed by
firs, pines, or larches, on to the broad expanse of the deep blue
sea, thou art all my fancy painted thee, thou art cucumbery in thy
coolness! and as I think of Royat and Aix-les-Bains I smile a
smile of gentle pitying wonder, and almost feel inclined to piously
pray for all poor bodies suffering from the canicular heat, whether
London doth still hold them in its toils, or stifling, smelling Continental
cities, are causing them to sigh for the balmy breezes of
Old England.</p>

<p>Thus then is it that "P'm'th"&mdash;that is "Pinemouth" in its abbreviated
form&mdash;is the place about which, as being comparatively
unknown at this season of the year, I beg to offer to <i>Mr. Punch</i>,
and through him to the world at large, for the ultimate benefit of
way-worn travellers, a few notes representing an uncommonly
pleasant experience, which, by the kind permission of "<i>Mr. P'n'h</i>"

<h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, September 4.</i>&mdash;What happened to-night
in connection with the Blameless <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, Bart., should have
useful effect in checking the tendencies of the censorious. Having
settled business arrangements by moving Resolution, Mr. G. skipped
out of House to pack up for his journey to Scotland. No boy at
end of term more eager for holiday; none more thoroughly earned.
In heat of discussion going forward on details of Resolution Mr. G.'s
departure not generally noticed. Only one faithful eye&mdash;or, to be
precise, a couple&mdash;followed his passage behind <span class="sc">Speaker's</span> chair.
Eyes dimmed with tears. For months, from early February to these
young September days, <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, Bart., has sat opposite Mr. G.,
has, so to speak, lived in his large and magnificent eye. Now association
about to be dissevered by withdrawal of the stately presence
from Treasury Bench. And only the other day he had referred to
<span class="sc">Bartley</span> as "the Hon. Baronet"!</p>

<p>For a while <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, Bart., sat silent and sorrowing. If it had
been the custom to wear sackcloth on the Opposition benches, and
any ashes had been handy, he would undoubtedly have endeavoured
to discover what secret consolation their use conveys. Nothing of
the kind to be had on the premises. After brooding for a while, he
up and spoke. "Where's the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>?" he cried aloud.
House hardly recognised in this wailing voice the stern accents
with which it is familiar from the same quarter. "It is not proper
that the House should sit without the <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>."</p>

<p><span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> (after all a kind-hearted man, quick to
sympathy) endeavoured to comfort the Bereaved. "Not proper,"
he exclaimed, "for House to sit without presence of <span class="sc">Prime Minister</span>!
Why, for six years we had no Prime Minister here."</p>

<p>"That's all very well, but," as <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, still weeping for the
<span class="sc">Premier</span> and not to be comforted, subsequently observed to Admiral
<span class="sc">Field</span>, "you can't mend a broken heart by a quip." <span class="sc">Hanbury</span> and
<span class="sc">Tommy Bowles</span> did their best to soothe him; walked him up and
down the Terrace; gave him a cup of tea, a bottle of smelling salts,
and a cabinet portrait of Mr. G. But it was only late at night,
when House had got into Committee, he so far recovered as to move
to reduce a vote by £100, in order to plead for some amelioration of
the lot of the Treasury Valuer.</p>

<p><i>House of Lords, Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Remember one night in years gone
by, whilst <span class="sc">Hartington</span> was still with us in the Commons, he
interrupted one of his own speeches by a portentous yawn. Complimented
him on the feat; few men, I said, would have the pluck
to do it; might yawn at other people's speeches, but never at
their own.</p>

<p>"Ah, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said <span class="sc">County Guy</span>, "you don't know how dem'd
dull the speech was. You only had to listen to some of it. I had to
deliver it all."</p>

<p class="center">Supporting the Crown.</p></div>

<p>Thought of this to-night listening to old friend in Lords, now
scarcely disguised as Duke of <span class="sc">Devonshire</span>. Spoke for nearly two
hours. Those who read it will find speech admirable; one of the best,
most weighty, indictments of Home Rule and the tactics that have
brought it into position of Ministerial measure. But alack! for those
who heard it, or, at least, sat through the two hours; not many, all
told; an hour enough for <span class="sc">The Macullum More</span>; other Peers on
both sides of House folded their tents like the Arab, and as silently
stole away. The <span class="sc">Markiss</span> gallantly kept his place, sitting for
some time with closed eyes, the better to concentrate his attention.
<span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> and <span class="sc">Joey C.</span>&mdash;lovely in the Commons, in the Lords
not divided&mdash;stood sturdily on either side of the Throne. "The Lion
and the Unicorn supporting the Crown," said <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>, glancing
across at them.</p>

<p class="center">The Devonshire Yawn.</p></div>

<p>For the ladies in the gallery, mothers and daughters, <span class="sc">Devonshire</span>
not so attractive a <i>parti</i> as was <span class="sc">Hartington</span>. Still, he is a
pillar of
the Union, a brand snatched from the burning pile to which the
wicked hand of Mr. G. applied the traitrous torch. So they sat and
listened&mdash;half an hour, three-quarters of an hour, an hour. Then
was heard the light rustle of dainty dresses; doors softly opened
along the Gallery; for a moment a
fair figure stood framed in it, with
guilty glance around to see if she was
observed; then, with winning "back-in-five-minutes"
look on innocent
face, she hastily stepped out.</p>

<p>The Duke saw none of these things
nor cared for them. He had a duty to
perform, and long before <span class="sc">Old Morality</span>
was heard of, the <span class="sc">Cavendishes</span>
did their duty. He plodded on through
the melancholy night; stolidly turning
over the pages of his notes; stubbornly
repressing a growing tendency
to yawn; catching his voice up when
it wearily sank to the level of his
boots; making most pathetic effort to
keep it going. Usually it fell away at
the end of the third or fourth sentence,
to be pulled up with harsh jerk at
commencement of one that followed.
A good man struggling with the adversity
of having to make a speech on
a topic harried to death in the other
House through course of over eighty
days.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Member for Sark,
waking up from gentle slumber indulged
in in corner seat at end of
Gallery; "but why didn't he halve
his adversity? If he'd been content
with an hour we should all have been
grateful, and he would have been spared a moiety of his anguish."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second Reading of Home-Rule Bill moved in
House of Lords.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Again a crowded assembly in Lords to-night to hear
its most brilliant Member. The Bishops, in great force, clustered, a
group of fluttering white lawn, on right of Woolsack. "The white
flower of a blameless Parliamentary life," the <span class="sc">Markiss</span> says of them.
Not an inch of red benches visible on Opposition side. Even
Ministerial benches full, though, as was made clear in course of
debate, not all who sit there are Ministerialists. <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>, looking
more boyish than ever, sat amid the elders on Front Bench; makes
no sign of intention to follow <span class="sc">Selborne</span>; takes no note nor betrays
other evidence of uneasiness. <span class="sc">Selborne</span> preaches for hour and half.
Understood to be sermon worthy of his fame; we Commoners in
gallery over bar could hear only fragmentary portions of sentences.
Reported that <span class="sc">Selborne</span> had lost his notes; Member for Sark
recognises
most kindly interposition of Providence.</p>

<p>"If he speaks for hour and half with only recollection of his notes
where would he have been if he had them?" Must get <span class="sc">Weir</span> to put
that conundrum to <span class="sc">Chancellor</span> of the Exchequer.</p>

<p>Grateful to <span class="sc">Rosebery</span>, since at least we can hear him, though he,
too, now and then falls into habit of dropping end of sentence. This
the less excusable, since none of them are heavy. A clever speech,
scarcely obscuring what seems to be difficult position. "Dancing
among the eggs," is <span class="sc">Balfour of Burghley's</span> commentary. Of all
listeners in the brilliant throng none so attentive as the <span class="sc">Markiss</span>.
Seems, on the
whole, to like
speech better than
does <span class="sc">Spencer</span>.</p>

<p>"Reminds me,
<span class="sc">Toby</span>," <span class="sc">Markiss</span>
says, "of what
<span class="sc">Lovelace</span> wrote
to <span class="sc">Lucasta</span>, 'on
going to the wars.'
How does it run?</p>

pegging away at

said a few genial

disappeared again.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
